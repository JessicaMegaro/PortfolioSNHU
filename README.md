Repository made to satisfy requirements to have professor as a collaborator and to upload a project later.

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What did you do particularly well?
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

In this project I felt that I programmed the functions particularly well. Since this was the third project we did, I feel that it was coming more naturally and I did not have to refer back to my books and zybooks for every function to ensure it was doing what I had intended.
I could enhance my code by placing more effort into doing new syntax that I have not learned yet. I am sure there are more efficient ways to code the projects that I have done, however I am not sure that trying new ways will make it anymore secure. I found it most difficult to understand why I would combine python with C++ for this project inparticular, though I now understand the rationale to combining languages to complete a project. I did a lot of reading on reddit forums and stackexchange to understand why or what tasks would be most appropriate for combining languages. As before, learning this skill as well as becoming more familiar with the syntax of C++ as well as python will transfer into any work I do from now on. I fully believe that the topics that were focused on in this course are playing a large role into how I style my particular code. I made this program maintainable by being easily read, and since two languages were used it can be more adaptable to those who know how to code in C++ as well as python. Proper use of whitespace and indenting makes the code very easy to follow and read, as well as proper commenting. Overall this was a very enjoyable project and I am proud of my work.
